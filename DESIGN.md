# 00. Design Director — project brief intake

## Project identity

### Product / app name
Pi-Crust.

### One-sentence product description
A Flutter desktop and web GUI for Pi coding-agent sessions, with chat, editable repository files and Git Changes (stage/commit/discard) organized as one workspace while Pi remains owner of session history.

### Core job-to-be-done
Find/create/switch Pi sessions; follow agent work in chat while editing the active session's repository and managing its Git Changes, then safely reattach after GUI interruption.

### Primary user
Pi coding-agent / CLI users who want session management and live agent interaction through a GUI. User prefers balance: fast routine paths plus discoverable controls for occasional use.

### Secondary users
No separate secondary audience established by current evidence.

### User context / scene
Local developer workstation on Windows, macOS or Web, with keyboard and pointer input. User selected equal platform priority. Users may follow long-running agent work intermittently; GUI can close or disconnect while the daemon preserves/replays events.

### Primary outcome / aha moment
User returns to intended Pi-owned session with history intact, can edit its repository and stage/commit/discard changes alongside agent work, and never loses unsaved edits or triggers hidden Git writes.

### Business or product priority
No business metric stated. Product evidence emphasizes continuity, trustworthy session control and local privacy.

### Non-negotiable constraints
Windows/macOS/Web at equal priority; local daemon and loopback security; no remote telemetry; Pi owns session files/history; preserve replay, drafts, queues, read-only session safeguards and extension UI; retain Italian copy and original Pi-Crust identity. During D9 human review, user superseded DR10 with Catppuccin Latte (light) + Frappé (dark), while retaining Bento work-area grouping. User requires editable active-session repository files and IDE-like Git Changes with explicit stage/undo; protect dirty edits and never hide writes. iOS/Android out of scope.

## 00.1 User-provided references

> References are part of the brief. Do not treat them as decoration.

### How to interpret references

Classify each reference as one or more of:

- `visual-inspiration`
- `interaction-inspiration`
- `brand-reference`
- `competitor`
- `platform-reference`
- `content/reference material`
- `technical/reference implementation`
- `anti-reference` — something we explicitly do NOT want

For every reference, extract:
1. what is useful;
2. what is not useful;
3. which design principle it suggests;
4. whether it is a direct constraint or merely inspiration;
5. where the principle should or should not appear in the product.

### Reference register

| ID | Type | Source | What to extract | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REF-010 | palette / theme reference | https://catppuccin.com/palette/; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/palette/refs/heads/main/palette.json | Official palette v1.8.0 named Latte and Frappé semantic colors/hex values; Latte is light, Frappé dark. — Principle: Map palette's named text, subtext, surface, base, mantle, crust and accent colors into app semantic theme roles; verify contrast rather than use accents decoratively. — Product need: Implement consistent light/dark semantic tokens matching selected Catppuccin flavors while preserving Pi-Crust identity and status semantics. | inspected |
| REF-009 | existing rendered UI screenshots | apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/review/precision/overview-light-1440.jpg; apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/review/precision/dark-1440-workspace.png; apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/review/precision/dark-390.png | Established app information architecture, actual session surface and responsive affordances; do not treat as new build output for this intake. — Principle: Session navigation, transcript and workspace controls persist across wide and compact layouts; focus remains on actual agent content. — Product need: A user should monitor and operate sessions from desktop and narrow client widths without losing essential controls. | inspected |
| REF-008 | superseded historical visual reference | https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design; archived product images in `apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/research/round2/` | Historical D6 input only. D9 round 4 explicitly removes this design language from the active direction; do not reuse its shape, palette or composition. | anti-reference |
| REF-007 | superseded historical visual reference | Archived `apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/research/round2/` captures and former source URLs | Historical D6 input only. D9 round 4 explicitly removes this design language from the active direction; do not reuse its visual style. | anti-reference |
| REF-006 | user-selected spatial/layout reference | design references/VisualStudioCode-Bento-Layout.png | Three-area inspiration: chat, opened-repository files, Git Changes. Use Bento grouping and compartment hierarchy; do not copy VS Code branding or exact chrome. Palette is now independently governed by user-selected REF-010. — Principle: Keep related work surfaces visible and legible together. — Product need: Users should interact with Pi sessions while seeing repository files and changes. | inspected |
| REF-005 | historical palette reference | DR10–by Matus Hatala.pdf; apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/research/palette-1.png | Historical D6 palette reference; distinguish source swatches from semantic values. Its former DR10 direction was explicitly superseded during D9 by REF-010 (Catppuccin Latte/Frappé). — Principle retained: status colors convey actual state, never decoration. — Product need: maintain readable contrast and semantic cues in the user's latest selected palette. | inspected |
| REF-004 | historical design records | apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/research/round2/ and `apps/pi_crust/.impeccable/surfaces/` | Historical D6 proposal and approval record only; superseded by explicit D9 rounds 2 and 4. Do not use prior surface language as current styling guidance. | inspected |
| REF-003 | app-level design contract | apps/pi_crust/DESIGN.md | Implementation-level Catppuccin and whole-app surface rules, maintained under this root contract. — Principle: align Flutter components to the current user-selected palette and surface grammar. | inspected |
| REF-002 | product brief | apps/pi_crust/PRODUCT.md | Primary user, core job, outcome, context, non-goals and hard constraints. — Principle: Pi-Crust is a desktop/web GUI over a local daemon, not an agent runtime or session-history owner. — Product need: Users want GUI affordances for Pi's sessions, transcripts, tools, workspace and extension prompts. | inspected |
| REF-001 | product and architecture brief | README.md | Product purpose, primary users, supported platforms, work continuity, session ownership, security and feature scope. — Principle: GUI can disconnect while Pi work persists; Pi remains history authority; daemon supplies local reconnect and event replay. — Product need: Make ongoing Pi coding work visible and manageable without taking ownership of sessions or depending on continuous GUI availability. | inspected |

### Reference precedence

When sources conflict, use this order:

`explicit user constraint → product truth → platform/accessibility requirement → established brand/system → selected visual direction → inspiration`

Inspiration never overrides an explicit product, accessibility, platform, or functional requirement.

### Reference analysis notes
Product, interaction, visual intent and constraints are separated in the synthesis below. User selects REF-006's Bento spatial grouping, with Catppuccin Latte + Frappé and rounded, lightly bordered surfaces across both panes and the rest of the interface. Preserve Pi-Crust identity; do not copy VS Code branding or exact chrome. REF-010 replaces the prior palette. REF-007/008 are archived anti-references and have no active design influence. References REF-001–REF-010 are registered; all are resolved.

### Reference conflicts

Record conflicts as:

`[CONFLICT-ID] competing principle → decision → precedence reason`

---

- **CONFLICT-001 — platform metadata:** `PRODUCT.md` metadata says Web; its body, root README and approved direction state Windows/macOS/Web. User selected equal priority; keep all three and reconcile stale metadata.
- **CONFLICT-002 — VS Code reference scope:** user wants Bento compartment organization and has specified its surface principles (separated, subtly bordered, rounded work areas); preserve Pi-Crust identity and do not copy VS Code branding or exact chrome.
- **CONFLICT-003 — Retired external design language:** user explicitly removed former product-design inspirations from the active direction; preserve Pi-Crust's original mark and use REF-010 for all theme colors.
- **CONFLICT-004 — prior single-transcript topology vs Bento request:** latest explicit user request uses chat, editable session-repository files and Git Changes as three work areas, with a consistent rounded/bordered grammar across the rest of the app. REF-010 supersedes the former palette.
- **CONFLICT-005 — inspect-only Git vs IDE-like change workflow:** user now requests unified changed-file list, diff-on-select, per-file stage/undo and truthful agent/manual provenance. Inspect-only status is insufficient; provenance feasibility must be verified before labeling.
- [CONFLICT-REF-010] **CONFLICT-006 — D9 visual revision:** user replaces former palette and square pane grammar with Catppuccin Latte/Frappé and rounded, subtly bordered surfaces throughout the app. Preserve Pi-Crust identity; Bento remains spatial grouping only.
- **CONFLICT-007 — D9 round-4 palette/surface correction:** theme names claimed Catppuccin while several Latte semantic values remained custom/off-palette, and non-pane UI remained square/flat. Latest feedback requires official palette colors and shared rounded borders beyond the Bento panes.
- [CONFLICT-CONFLICT-007] Documented in DESIGN.md §00.1 conflicts and D9 round-4 design decision.

# 00.3 Adaptive discovery interview

> The Design Director uses a bounded adaptive interview rather than a fixed questionnaire. Candidate questions are ranked by expected information gain: impact × uncertainty × dependency × answerability × novelty, with a small boost for blocking decisions. The agent asks only the top 1–3 questions per round and stops when readiness reaches the project threshold with no blocking gaps.

<!-- DD_INTERVIEW_STATUS_START -->
### Current interview status

## design brief
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:design_brief -->
### design brief

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-005, REF-006

**Pi-Crust** is a Flutter desktop/web companion for Pi coding-agent users. Scope includes session discovery/switching, Pi session health/metrics, repository editing, Git review/actions, context attachments and Pi package management while Pi remains session-history owner. Bento Triptych remains the spatial direction: repository/editor, Pi chat and Git Changes co-visible on wide layouts. D9 feedback selects official Catppuccin Latte/Frappé colors and a consistent rounded, subtly bordered surface grammar throughout panes, settings, sessions, chat, composer, dialogs and controls. The retired D6 palette and creative references are not active guidance. Compact layout remains adaptive and state-preserving. **Confidence: high.** Evidence: REF-001, REF-002, REF-006, REF-010; Q-VISUAL-DIRECTION/Q-D6-LOCK; D9 human review rounds 2 and 4.

### evidence synthesis

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-003, REF-004, REF-005, REF-006, REF-007, REF-008, REF-009

**Product truth:** Pi-Crust GUI for Pi coding-agent users; Pi owns session history and local daemon preserves process/replay continuity. **Interaction truth:** equal Windows/macOS/Web priority; keyboard+pointer; session tree groups by repository/folder, and selected folder can seed new-session cwd; worker sessions are hidden by default. Chat shows Pi model/thinking/context/cost metadata and accepts file/line references. Repository and Git review are unified around changed tracked files, diffs, explicit stage/undo, with agent/manual provenance. Panels are resizable/hideable; settings expose installed Pi package lifecycle. **Visual intent:** retain Bento spatial grouping; use exact Catppuccin Latte/Frappé palette values and extend consistent modest rounding/subtle borders to non-pane UI. Retired D6 palette and design references must not shape implementation. **Constraints/conflicts:** local-only/no telemetry; preserve Pi's session and package ownership; maintain explicit, safe Git writes; REF-010 governs palette. Product metadata still says Web-only despite user-confirmed platform parity (CONFLICT-001). **Confidence: high** for user requests; exact use of palette accents must preserve text contrast. Evidence: REF-001–REF-010; D9 human review rounds 2 and 4.

## product brief
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:product_brief -->
### product brief

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-006

**Product/app:** Pi-Crust, GUI companion for Pi coding-agent. **Primary user:** Pi coding-agent/CLI users; user wants balanced speed and discoverability. **Core job:** find/switch sessions by repository, follow Pi work and manage source/Git context without losing Pi-owned history. Requested outcomes now include folder-scoped session creation, a repository-grouped session tree without worker# noise, in-chat session metrics, editable files and diff-first Git operations, file/line context attachments, resizable panes and Pi package lifecycle controls. **Priority:** continuity, safe explicit changes, local privacy and an integrated IDE-like workbench. **Confidence: high** for requested scope; implementation/API feasibility remains open. Evidence: REF-001, REF-002, REF-006, REF-010; D9 human review round 2.

## interaction brief
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:interaction_brief -->
### interaction brief

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-003, REF-004, REF-005, REF-006

**Platforms:** Windows desktop, macOS desktop and Web at equal priority; iOS/Android out of scope. Windows keeps native caption/window actions, macOS keeps native window conventions, Web remains served from the local daemon origin with browser controls. **Primary input:** keyboard + mouse/pointer; standard text editing, visible focus, keyboard navigation and explicit pointer controls. Existing shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+K command palette, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter send, Escape interrupt. New editor shortcuts remain to be designed, not assumed.

**Workspace model:** Session index groups sessions by repository/folder, suppresses `worker#` subagent entries by default, and lets users create a session from a selected folder. Bento work areas are resizable/hideable; compact layout retains explicit pane switching and state. **Repository/Git:** show changed tracked files, distinguish agent/manual origin when evidence permits, select a file to view its diff, offer per-file stage and undo, and keep writes explicit/recoverable. **Chat context:** allow file attachments and line-specific references from editor selection/context menu; show model, thinking, context-window and cost metadata plus supported Pi package controls. **File safety:** edits stay inside active session repo, dirty buffers survive panes, external conflicts preserve both versions, and session switches resolve dirty files before changing cwd. **Git safety:** undo/discard names the exact file and confirms destructive loss; stage/commit are explicit and guarded against active Pi writes. **Accessibility:** keyboard/focus, semantics, large text and contrast must be tested before claiming complete.

**Confidence:** high for direct user constraints and platforms; medium for these safety/adaptive decisions. Evidence: REF-001–REF-006; Q-PLATFORM, Q-FILE-VIEW, Q-REPO-CONTEXT, Q-GIT-ACTIONS; current `app_shell.dart`, `context_panel.dart`, root README and daemon `gitClient.ts`.

### ux flow brief

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-006

**Primary critical flow: Find/switch session and resume project work**

**User intent:** Return to intended Pi conversation and continue in correct repository without losing history or edits.

**Start state:** Launch/reopen at session index; daemon connected, reconnecting or unavailable; session list populated, empty or loading.

**Main path:** Browse/search sessions grouped by repository/folder (worker# rows hidden by default) → select session or choose folder for new session → verify title/cwd and read-only/agent state → inspect Pi chat metrics, repository/editor and unified Git Changes → select changed file for diff → edit/save or stage/undo explicitly; add files/selected line ranges to chat context when needed.

**Alternative paths:** No match → reset filters or create session. No Git repo → chat remains usable; explain unavailable panes. Read-only/ambiguous session → allow safe inspection but disable repository writes. Compact width → explicit pane switcher preserves state.

**Errors / interruption / recovery:** Daemon failure → retry/reconnect; journal gap → fresh snapshot; worker crash → explicit recovery, no blind replay; filtered empty → reset. Save failure retains dirty buffer; concurrent file change preserves both versions and offers compare/reload/keep. Dirty session switch/window close offers Save / Discard / Cancel. Git failure retains selection/state; refresh before writes; discard previews and confirms target; serialize/reject writes racing active Pi changes.

**Completion:** Correct session identity/cwd and transcript visible; file/Git panes match cwd; save/Git result explicit.

**Success signal:** Intended context reached; Pi history gap-free; no silent overwrite or hidden Git mutation.

**Exit:** Continue chat/editing, switch pane, return to session list or close after resolving dirty buffers.

**Secondary flows — repository/Git and context:** Select modified tracked file → inspect diff → stage with per-file plus or undo after impact/confirmation; preserve agent-vs-manual provenance when protocol provides it. Select file or source lines → Add to chat with stable path and line range. Settings show installed Pi packages with individual update/remove/pin actions, subject to Pi CLI/package APIs.

Design hypothesis: wide workspace exposes three Bento work areas; compact layout uses explicit pane switching and preserves state. Current app has session search and read-only Git status/diffs only; editor/Git writes are new scope. No destructive action is automatic. Confidence: high for user-selected task/scope; medium-high for safety. Evidence: REF-001, REF-002, REF-006; Q-FLOW/Q-FILE-VIEW/Q-REPO-CONTEXT/Q-GIT-ACTIONS; `sessions_sidebar.dart`, `app_shell.dart`, `composer.dart`, `context_panel.dart`, daemon `gitClient.ts`.

## design implications
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:design_implications -->
### design implications

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-003, REF-004, REF-005, REF-006, REF-009

**Bento remains the spatial grouping, not a pane-only skin.** Apply the exact named Catppuccin Latte/Frappé colors; do not replace palette colors with old contrast-shifted hues. Where an accent cannot carry small text accessibly, pair it with a Catppuccin text/surface color and use the accent for icons, borders or tinted state surfaces. Use modest radii and 1px subtle borders for other functional surfaces too: session rows, message/tool/code blocks, composer, settings cards, inputs, dialogs and menus. Preserve Pi-Crust identity and avoid copying VS Code chrome. Minimize/maximize stalls are reported improved; keep transcript lazy layout. **Confidence: high** for explicit direction; exact component sizes remain implementation choices. Evidence: REF-010; D9 review rounds 2 and 4.

### constraints non goals

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-003, REF-004, REF-005, REF-006

**Hard constraints:** Windows/macOS/Web equal priority; local loopback daemon/token/origin security; zero remote telemetry; Pi owns session history and package lifecycle; preserve replay, drafts, queues, read-only safeguards and extension UI; keep Italian UI and original Pi-Crust identity. D9 requirements: exact Catppuccin Latte/Frappé palette; rounded, subtly bordered surfaces across the whole application; resizable/hideable Bento panes; repository-grouped non-worker sessions and folder-scoped creation; visible Pi metrics; integrated diff-first Git Changes with explicit stage/undo and truthful origin labels; file/line-to-chat context; Pi package management. Preserve dirty buffers, confirm destructive undo, and guard writes against active Pi changes. **Non-goals:** changing Pi session/history ownership; remote/cloud repo access or telemetry; iOS/Android; copying VS Code branding/exact chrome; reactivating retired D6 design references; auto-stage/commit or hidden data loss. **Confidence: high** for requested outcomes.

## open decisions
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:open_decisions -->
### open decisions

**Confidence:** high
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-003, REF-004, REF-006

1. **Platform metadata:** `apps/pi_crust/PRODUCT.md` frontmatter says Web while body/README/design history and user decision specify equal Windows/macOS/Web; preserve parity and reconcile when product docs are next edited (CONFLICT-001).
2. **Quantitative business success metric:** none supplied; qualitative outcomes remain correct session context, safe file/Git changes and continuous Pi history.
3. **Runtime after user restart:** previous `daemon.json` still names PID 40604, which is no longer running. Launch the rebuilt app and confirm it starts a fresh daemon before testing workspace/package commands.
4. **Change provenance:** Git can report changed paths/status but agent-vs-manual authorship may not be derivable from current snapshots. Investigate Pi/daemon write provenance; never guess labels.
5. **Pi package lifecycle runtime:** user-scope list/update/remove/pin implementation and isolated tests exist; confirm the restarted app's live daemon can list packages before human review.
**Direction lock:** Bento Triptych spatial topology remains. D9 user explicitly revised palette and shape (REF-010; rounded Catppuccin compartments); this is a user-directed refinement, not permission to clone IDE branding.
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_END:open_decisions -->

## assumptions
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_START:assumptions -->
### assumptions

**Confidence:** medium
**Evidence:** REF-001, REF-002, REF-003

**Resolved by user:** balance throughput and discoverability; repository files are editable/saveable; file/Git context follows active session cwd; Git Changes supports stage/commit/discard. Treat these as explicit product requirements, not assumptions.
- **A-002 — Keyboard + mouse/pointer is primary across desktop and Web.** Inferred from platform scope, composer, command shortcut and window controls; no mobile-native target. Risk: browser sessions on touch devices may need more touch adaptation. Evidence: REF-001–REF-003.
- **A-003 — Local developer workstation and intermittent session monitoring are typical.** Inferred from Pi coding-agent context and persistent daemon/reconnect architecture; exact cadence/time pressure is unknown. Risk: remote/shared environments could change recovery and collaboration needs. Evidence: REF-001, REF-002.
**Design Director decisions, not user questions:** protect dirty buffers; Save / Discard / Cancel before losing edits; compare/reload/keep on external conflicts; refresh and identify targets before writes; commit reviewed staged files only; preview/confirm discard; adapt three areas across widths. Exact copy and implementation mechanics remain for later design/build. No demographics or business metrics invented. **Confidence: medium.**
<!-- DD_SYNTHESIS_END:assumptions -->

### A-001
Resolved by user Q-USER: balance high-frequency throughput with discoverability for occasional users; no assumption remains about which group dominates.
### A-002
Inferred from target platforms and source; documented as assumption, not user-confirmed input preference.
### A-003
Reasonable inference from local coding-agent use and daemon continuity architecture; exact cadence remains unknown.

# 01. Product truth

## What the app does

Current client provides GUI session discovery/operation, streaming transcript, prompt/steer/interrupt, workspace Git status/diff and extension UI; a local daemon preserves execution/replay across GUI disconnects. **User-requested expansion:** active-session repository files must be editable/saveable, and Git Changes must support stage/commit/discard actions alongside Pi chat. These editor and Git write capabilities are not present in current feature code reviewed.

## What the app does not do

It does not replace Pi, own Pi's session files/history, run the agent inside Flutter, send remote telemetry, or target iOS/Android. It does not blindly replay uncertain commands after a daemon identity change.

## Core entities / objects

Pi session and branch/tree; user/assistant messages; reasoning and tool events; queued steer/follow-up prompts; active-session repository tree, editable file and dirty buffer; Git changed-file/staged state, diff and commit; model/thinking settings; daemon connection, snapshot and replay cursor; extension UI request.

## User goals

| Goal | Priority | Frequency | Success signal |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Find/switch Pi sessions, edit session-repository files and manage Git changes | P0 | Recurring; exact cadence unknown | Correct session context; edits save safely; Git writes are explicit; no history loss/duplicate replay |

## Critical scenarios

- User launches/reconnects client to local daemon and resumes session from replay/snapshot.
- User creates/selects a session, follows streamed text/tool work, sends or steers a prompt, and interrupts safely.
- User encounters a session already possibly open in terminal and uses read-only/clone/explicit-confirm recovery rather than concurrent writes.
- User edits and saves a repository file alongside Pi chat; app must preserve unsaved content and resolve concurrent agent/external edits safely.
- User stages/commits/discards Git changes after editing a file; target and consequences remain clear and failures recover safely.
- User inspects workspace diff or Pi extension request; handles empty, daemon-disconnected and worker-failed states.

## Content reality

Document realistic:

- minimum content;
- typical content;
- maximum / extreme content;
- missing content;
- user-generated content;
- localized content;
- sensitive / high-stakes content where applicable.

Sessions contain user prompts, streamed assistant text, reasoning, tool arguments/output, code, diffs, queue state, branch/session metadata, model settings and extension UI payloads. Content length and session history can grow; exact production maxima are not documented. Names, previews, cwd and model data can be missing. Existing UI copy is predominantly Italian. Session history and workspace details are developer data; preserve Pi ownership and avoid exporting secrets in diagnostics.

---

# 02. Interaction environment

The interface must be designed around the actual input/output environment.

## Target platforms

- [ ] iOS
- [ ] Android
- [ ] iPad/tablet
- [x] macOS
- [x] Windows
- [ ] Linux
- [x] Web
- [ ] Other: not identified

Windows, macOS and Web have equal priority by user choice; PRODUCT.md frontmatter conflicts with other project evidence (CONFLICT-001).

## Primary input

Keyboard + mouse/pointer on desktop/Web; desktop keyboard shortcut and text-composer paths are explicit in source. No mobile-native or touch-first target is established.



## Input behavior

Document:
- tap / press;
- long press;
- drag;
- swipe;
- scroll;
- hover;
- secondary click;
- keyboard shortcuts;
- focus traversal;
- text selection;
- pointer precision needs;
- Gesture cancellation/interruption: keyboard actions remain immediate; inspector motion is interruptible and reduced-motion aware per approved app direction.

Keyboard + pointer for session search/selection, chat composition, repository tree navigation and editing. Preserve Ctrl/Cmd+K command palette, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter send and Escape interrupt. Editor uses standard text-editing keys; ensure focus can move among chat, file tree/editor and Git Changes without trapping. Git actions show repository/branch and exact file targets; discard previews impact and requires confirmation; commit operates on reviewed staged files. Dirty buffers survive pane changes; session switch/window close offers Save / Discard / Cancel. External file changes preserve the user's buffer and offer compare/reload/retry. Windows keeps integrated drag/standard window actions; macOS native window behavior; Web follows browser keyboard/navigation conventions. Full accessibility QA remains pending.

## Primary output

Desktop monitor or browser window. Wide layouts expose chat, repository tree/editor and Git Changes together; compact layouts keep chat primary and provide explicit pane switching/drawers with per-pane state preserved. Screen-reader and large-text validation remain pending.



## Context of use

Local developer workstation. User may monitor a long-running Pi task intermittently, edit repository files while Pi is active, or lose the GUI/daemon connection. Session cwd binds repository context; Pi work remains replayable. User prefers balanced throughput and discoverability. Exact work cadence/time pressure remains unknown.

Consider:
- one-handed use;
- standing / moving;
- bright outdoor light;
- low-light environment;
- noisy environment;
- intermittent connectivity;
- time pressure;
- frequent/repetitive operations;
- expert users;
- novice users.

## Platform conventions

The Design Director must document where the app follows platform norms and where it intentionally deviates.

### iOS
Out of scope; no iOS-specific interface.

### Android
Out of scope; no Android-specific interface.

### Desktop / web
Preserve platform-native window behavior; Windows integrated caption actions, macOS native titlebar, Web browser conventions. Use Ctrl/Cmd variants for shared shortcuts. Web is served from the local daemon origin. Equal platform priority means feature parity, not identical pane layout at every width.

### Shared behavior
Selected session cwd defines file tree and Git Changes. Wide workspace presents chat, editable file area and Git Changes as distinct panes; compact workspace exposes explicit pane switcher/drawers, keeping chat default and preserving pane state. Dirty edits require save/discard/cancel before session-context loss; stale files cannot silently overwrite; Git mutations identify exact repository/files and result.

---

# 03. Information architecture & flow model

## Primary navigation

Session index → active-session workspace. Wide workspace shows Pi chat + editable repository files + Git Changes; compact layout switches among these areas without losing state. Repository context follows active session cwd; settings and command palette remain global utilities.

## Top-level destinations

Sessions, Pi chat/transcript/composer, editable opened-repository files, Git Changes, workspace/model details, settings/diagnostics.

## Entry points

Launch/reopen Pi-Crust; connect to daemon; open the session index; select an existing session or create one. No deep-link route is established by current evidence.

## Exit points

Switch session, open settings/workspace, or close/reload GUI. Closing GUI must not be represented as stopping Pi work; daemon keeps running.

## Back behavior

Use platform dismissal/back behavior for drawers and dialogs; session switching returns focus to selected transcript. No browser deep-link/back contract is documented.

## Deep links / notifications / external entry

No supported deep-link, notification or external session-entry path identified.

---

## Critical flow: Find and switch sessions

### User intent

Return to the intended Pi conversation or switch into another existing session without losing its identity or history.

### Start state

Pi-Crust is open at the session index; daemon may be connected, connecting or reconnecting. The user recognizes a project/session name, cwd or recent preview. List may be populated, empty, loading or unavailable.

### Main path

Search/filter by name, ID, cwd, preview or activity; select a session; verify title/cwd and read-only/agent state; active cwd becomes repository root; inspect chat, repository tree/editor and Git Changes; read/edit/save a file; refresh status/diff; optionally stage explicit files, commit reviewed staged files with message, or preview and confirm discard.

### Alternative paths

No match → clear/reset filters or create a session; no Git repository → keep chat usable and explain unavailable file/Git areas; read-only/ambiguous session → allow safe browsing but disable repository writes until ownership is safe; compact width → explicit pane switcher/drawers preserve file and scroll state.

### Errors / interruption / recovery

Daemon unavailable → retry/reconnect while Pi history remains authoritative; journal gap → fresh snapshot; worker failure → explicit recovery, no blind command replay; ambiguous terminal session → read-only explanation/clone or confirmed safe continue; filtered empty → reset. Save failure → retain dirty buffer and retry; concurrent file edit → preserve both and compare/reload/keep; dirty session switch/app close → Save / Discard / Cancel. Git failure → keep selection/status and report operation; refresh before writes; discard previews targets and requires confirmation; stale writes during active Pi work are serialized or rejected.

### Completion

Target session becomes active; its identity and cwd are visible, Pi-owned transcript is current, and repository files plus Git Changes reflect that session before further edits or Git actions.

### Success signal

User reaches intended session, can chat/edit/review Git changes in its repository, and has clear unsaved/staged state without history gaps, duplicate events or hidden repository writes.

### Known friction

Current app has session filters/search and read-only Git status/diffs but no editor or Git write actions. Verify filtered-empty recovery, correct session/repository association, unsaved-file recovery and safe Git mutation feedback.

### Design hypothesis

Keep search/filters adjacent to session index; selected session identity determines file/Git context; organize chat, editable files and Git Changes as distinct related areas; balance routine speed with visible affordances; distinguish filtered-empty from lost/unavailable session; preserve dirty edits and make Git writes explicit. Adapt three areas across widths while keeping each reachable. Based on user answers, reference and existing implementation, not usability-test evidence.

## Secondary flow: Edit a repository file and manage its Git change

### User intent
Edit source in active Pi session's repository, understand resulting change, and apply only intended Git operations.

### Start state
Selected session has a canonical repository root; file pane shows repository tree; session may be idle or Pi may be working.

### Main path
Select file → edit in buffer → save explicitly → refresh Git status/diff → review exact file and diff → stage/unstage selected file → optionally commit reviewed staged files with explicit message.

### Alternative paths
Close or switch pane with editor state preserved; session switch or window close while dirty offers Save / Discard / Cancel; no repository or unsupported file type leaves chat usable and explains limit.

### Errors / interruption / recovery
Save failure keeps buffer; external/Pi edit conflict offers compare/reload/keep; stale Git status refreshes before write; commit failure retains staged selection/message; discard shows affected files/diff and requires confirmation; concurrent worker mutation is serialized or rejected, never silently raced.

### Completion
Saved file appears in Git Changes with accurate status/diff; staged/committed/discarded action reports actual result.

### Success signal
No silent overwrite or mutation; user can identify repository, branch, files and saved/staged state.

### Known friction
Current client has no source editor or Git write API. File-root containment, dirty-buffer recovery and safe worker concurrency require implementation design.

### Design hypothesis
Keep editor state alive across pane changes; stage/commit/discard target explicit files; commit staged files only; make destructive discard previewable; block writes outside active repository root.

---

# 04. UX principles

These are product-specific principles, not generic slogans.

### Principle 1
**Session is context boundary:** active session identity and cwd govern chat, repository files and Git Changes; never hide context switches.

### Principle 2
**Chat, code and changes are peers:** three clear work areas; selected Bento Triptych keeps each role legible and related.

### Principle 3
**Every write is accountable:** edits, staging, commit and discard name their targets, preserve recoverable state and report results.

### Cognitive load
Balance throughput and discoverability. Keep current session/repository and dirty/staged state visible; avoid duplicating metadata across panes.

### Progressive disclosure
Keep session search, chat and file navigation direct. Show Git write actions in Git Changes, but require explicit selection and reveal consequences before commit/discard.

### Feedback & system status
Distinguish daemon connection, Pi run state, file saved/dirty/conflict state, Git staged/unstaged state and operation result with text/icon and color.

### Errors & recovery
Preserve buffers and selections on save/Git failures. Compare/reload/keep on disk conflict; Save / Discard / Cancel before losing dirty edits; never replay uncertain agent commands.

### Empty states
Differentiate no sessions, no search results, no Git repository, clean Git tree, and no file selected. Offer a specific next action without theatrical illustration.

### Onboarding / first value
No onboarding ceremony. First value is selecting a real session and immediately seeing its chat, cwd-bound repository and Git state.

### Expert workflows
Keep keyboard search, editing and chat paths efficient; preserve per-session drafts and editor state across pane changes. Do not require mouse-only Git actions.

---

# 05. Visual world

## Creative North Star

**A session-bound coding workbench:** keep Pi conversation, active-project files and change consequences in one coherent working field. Each surface has a clear job; no file or Git write is hidden.

Bento defines spatial grouping, not a styling rule limited to the three panes. Use Catppuccin Latte/Frappé colors and a consistent soft-rounded, subtly bordered grammar across the whole app. Preserve Pi-Crust's own mark and name.

## Emotional character

- Precise
- Composed
- Discoverable
- Accountable

## Visual ingredients

### Color world
Use official Catppuccin values, not contrast-shifted approximations. Latte: Base `#eff1f5`, Mantle `#e6e9ef`, Surface0 `#ccd0da`, Text `#4c4f69`, Mauve `#8839ef`, Green `#40a02b`, Yellow `#df8e1d`, Red `#d20f39`, Blue `#1e66f5`. Frappé: Base `#303446`, Mantle `#292c3c`, Surface0 `#414559`, Text `#c6d0f5`, Mauve `#ca9ee6`, Green `#a6d189`, Yellow `#e5c890`, Red `#e78284`, Blue `#8caaee`. Mauve is primary accent; Green/Yellow/Red/Blue keep semantic status roles. Use low-contrast accents for icons, borders or tinted surfaces, not small text; pair them with named text colors.

### Typography voice
Keep bundled Barlow Condensed for identity/headings, Schibsted Grotesk for UI reading, and Source Code Pro for file paths/code/diffs. Let source content carry visual interest; avoid decorative display use in dense editor content.

### Material / texture
Use one coherent Catppuccin surface family in both themes. Major panes, settings sections, composer, transcript blocks, tool/code surfaces, dialogs and input controls use a quiet 1px border, modest corner radius and clear spacing. Avoid bare square rectangles and near-black-only components in Latte. Avoid glass, gradients, deep shadows and nested card stacks.

### Shape language
Semantic radii: 6px small, 10px medium, 14px large; pane gutters stay narrow. Rounded borders apply to functional non-pane surfaces too, without turning every row or label into a card.

### Density
Balanced: enough source/Git detail for frequent CLI users, with visible labels and recoverable controls for occasional users. Wide layouts expose three work areas; compact layouts switch panes without losing state.

### Image / illustration language
No decorative photography or illustrations on work surfaces. Real repository files, code, diffs and session content are primary visual material.

### Iconography
Use familiar software/action icons with labels or tooltips; status meaning never relies on color alone. Do not copy VS Code product marks or proprietary icon shapes.

### Motion language
Keep keyboard actions immediate. Use short, interruptible pane transitions and subtle pointer feedback only; preserve reduced-motion behavior. No decorative entrance loops or streaming text theatrics.

### Composition / grid
**Selected direction: Bento Triptych.** Keep session navigation distinct from three co-visible wide work areas: repository/editor, Pi chat and Git Changes. At compact/medium widths, chat is default and explicit pane switching exposes files or changes without losing state. Proportions remain a design-system refinement.

## Distinctive product signatures

- **Session-bound workspace:** one visible session identity/cwd anchors chat, files and Git state.
- **Change consequence:** selected file, saved/dirty state, staged state and diff remain visibly connected.
- **Explicit action grammar:** stage, commit and discard always name repository/target and show outcome.

## Anti-reference

No VS Code logo, copied chrome or exact component clone; no generic AI/SaaS card dashboard, nested cards, glass/gradients, fake hardware or hidden repository writes. Preserve original Pi-Crust mark; Catppuccin colors and semantic status cues are now normative.

---

# 06. Direction exploration

Use only for new products, major redesigns, or materially open visual direction.

## Candidate directions

These are historical D6 composition candidates. Round-4 direction keeps Bento spatial grouping and supersedes their palette and surface treatments with official Catppuccin colors and consistent rounded borders.

### Direction: Bento Triptych

**Thesis**  
Chat, repository files and Git Changes are three first-class work surfaces; session identity ties them together.

**Why this belongs to the product**  
Direct translation of the user request and REF-006 spatial grouping into Pi-Crust's own working grammar.

**Audience / cultural resonance**  
Balanced for frequent Pi operators and occasional users: clearly labeled panes, familiar session navigation and immediate cross-reference between agent, source and changes.

**Palette strategy**  
Official Catppuccin Latte/Frappé semantic colors. Do not retain DR10 or custom contrast-shifted accent hues.

**Type strategy**  
Barlow Condensed for brand/pane headings; Schibsted Grotesk for controls and transcript; Source Code Pro for paths, source and diff.

**Shape/material strategy**  
Rounded, subtly bordered panes and functional surfaces across the app; tight gutters; flat surfaces without shadows or nested card stacks.

**Composition strategy**  
Session navigation remains a slim rail/drawer. Wide workspace: repository file tree/editor left (~30%), Pi chat center (~46%), Git Changes right (~24%). Compact: chat default with explicit Repository/Git Changes pane switcher; preserve editor and scroll state.

**Signature interaction**  
Selecting a file keeps session/chat in place and shows that file's saved/dirty and Git status in adjacent Changes pane; no hidden context switch.

**Honest risk**  
Four navigational regions including session index can crowd medium windows; needs careful minimum widths and compact pane switching.

**Anti-slop rationale**  
Every pane contains real session/repository data. Bento divisions encode distinct user jobs, not decorative cards or invented metrics.

### Decision

selected

### Reason

User chose Bento Triptych and explicitly confirmed the lock; `/design lock` persisted D6. It most directly satisfies three co-visible named work areas while preserving Pi-Crust identity.

### D9 human-review revision (active)

Keep Bento topology, not the retired D6 design language. Use official Catppuccin Latte/Frappé values and extend modest rounding/subtle borders to non-pane UI. Remove former external creative references from active decisions; preserve Pi-Crust identity. Maintain the D9 session-tree, Git/diff, metrics, package-management, context-attachment and resizable-pane requirements. See rounds 2 and 4 in Human review log.

### Direction: Artifact Atlas

**Thesis**  
The source file is primary artifact; chat explains and changes ledger records consequences.

**Why this belongs to the product**  
Users need inspectable, editable repository files and safe Git operations alongside Pi's work; this composition foregrounds code and its history.

**Audience / cultural resonance**  
Frequent code-reading/editing users, while retaining discoverable chat/Git labels and stable session identity.

**Palette strategy**  
Would use the active Catppuccin Latte/Frappé semantic pair; this alternative differs only in information priority and remains rejected.

**Type strategy**  
Source Code Pro takes more hierarchy in editor/file tree; Schibsted Grotesk carries transcript/controls; condensed Barlow remains brand-only.

**Shape/material strategy**  
Document-like open editor plane, fine line numbers and rules, restrained pane boundaries; diff uses explicit added/removed status colors and text labels.

**Composition strategy**  
Explorer/file tree left, broad editor center, Git Changes as a shallow bottom ledger, persistent chat column right. Compact layouts switch between source+changes and chat.

**Signature interaction**  
Selecting a changed path opens the working file while keeping its diff/status linked in the bottom Changes ledger.

**Honest risk**  
Chat may feel secondary to code editing, shifting Pi-Crust toward a full IDE and increasing scope.

**Anti-slop rationale**  
Hierarchy comes from actual code, path and diff semantics—not generic IDE chrome, decorative tabs or fake activity metrics.

### Decision

rejected

### Reason

User selected a balanced three-area Bento composition; code-first editor dominance would over-prioritize source editing.

### Direction: Conversation Desk

**Thesis**  
The live Pi conversation remains center of gravity; files and Git Changes are always nearby supporting instruments.

**Why this belongs to the product**  
Pi-Crust's primary job is still session interaction. User can inspect/edit source and manage changes without letting repository chrome overwhelm agent work.

**Audience / cultural resonance**  
Occasional users and balanced workflows; chat is immediately legible, while labeled file/Git surfaces remain reachable and visible on wide screens.

**Palette strategy**  
Would use the active Catppuccin Latte/Frappé semantic pair; this alternative differs only in information priority and remains rejected.

**Type strategy**  
Schibsted Grotesk leads transcript/controls; Barlow Condensed marks session identity; Source Code Pro remains limited to source, path and diff.

**Shape/material strategy**  
Open conversation plane with a compact repository navigator and a crisp, narrow Git Changes ledger; thin dividers rather than tiles.

**Composition strategy**  
Chat receives the broad center (~55%); repository files sit as a left work pane and Git Changes as a right rail (~20–25%). Compact mode defaults to chat and uses clearly labeled pane switching.

**Signature interaction**  
A file/branch context label persists in the chat header; pane switches preserve conversation scroll and draft, making current repository explicit.

**Honest risk**  
Editor and Git Changes may be too narrow for long paths, code and staged-file review; could bias product away from the user's three first-class areas.

**Anti-slop rationale**  
Conversation hierarchy is caused by Pi-Crust's core job; no chat bubbles, generic AI dashboard cards or decorative assistant glyphs.

### Decision

rejected

### Reason

Would visually subordinate repository files and Git Changes despite user's explicit three-area requirement.

---

# 07. Design system

Only create or expand abstractions that have a clear shared intent.

## Tokens

### Semantic colors
`crust-light.json` / `crust-dark.json` must use the official named Latte/Frappé hex values for `background/chassis`, `surface/displaySurface`, text/subtext, `accent/focusRing`, `success/warning/danger/info`, `agent*`, syntax and diff roles. Primary accent is Catppuccin Mauve; Green, Yellow, Red and Blue map to success, warning, danger and info. Status and syntax accents that miss text contrast pair with Catppuccin text/surface colors; never invent darker replacement hues. Latte chat/composer use coordinated light surfaces; Frappé uses layered dark surfaces.

### Typography roles
Keep bundled Schibsted Grotesk for UI/body (14px base, 1.5 line-height); Barlow Condensed for brand and pane headings; Source Code Pro for code, file paths, commit messages and diffs. Existing roles: 11/12/14/16/20/28px; 400/500/600 weights. Preserve text scaling and avoid condensed type for long reading.

### Spacing scale
4px base unit; keep work-area gutters tight (about 6px), with 4/8/12/16/24/32/48px inner spacing. Use compact session/Git rows and reserve larger gaps for hierarchy, not repeated list padding.

### Radii / shape
Use 1px subtle borders and 6/10/14px semantic radii (small/medium/large). Apply to panes and non-pane functional surfaces; keep list rows compact and avoid giant cards or pill treatment.

### Elevation / surface hierarchy
Use aligned Catppuccin surfaces, thin borders and small gaps to separate compartments; avoid heavy shadows. Reserve native elevation for menus/dialogs.

### Motion
Existing tokens: 120ms pointer press feedback; 240ms pane movement with drawer curve. Keyboard actions stay immediate. Respect reduced motion; no decorative launch or streaming animations.

### Breakpoints / size classes
Use current content-driven classes: compact <900px; medium 900–1439px; expanded ≥1440px. Compact: chat default + explicit Repository/Git Changes switcher. Medium: chat + one companion pane. Expanded: Bento Triptych visible; collapse session navigation before shrinking work panes. Revalidate exact widths with rendered layouts.

## Shared components

| Component | Intent | Variants | States | Accessibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Session navigator | Find/create/switch Pi session | Repository tree, folder-scoped creation, hidden worker rows | Loading, empty, filtered-empty, selected, error | Search/tree semantics, keyboard traversal, clear folder context |
| Bento panes | Identify and arrange work areas | Repository, Pi chat, Git Changes; resize/hide | Visible, hidden, resized, compact switcher | Named controls, focus, persist pane state |
| Repository/Git workbench | Browse source and inspect changes | Changed tracked files, diff/editor, stage/undo, provenance | Clean, dirty, stale, error, read-only | Exact paths/ranges, confirm destructive undo, preserve dirty text |
| Pi chat/composer | Follow/send work and attach context | Streaming, settled, read-only, file/line references | Loading, empty, queued, interrupted, error | Preserve shortcuts; announce selected file/range and metadata |
| Session metrics | Show Pi work state | Model, thinking, context usage, cost, extension settings | Loading, unavailable, stale | Text labels/units; never fabricate unavailable data |
| Pi package manager | Inspect/update installed Pi packages | Per-package update/remove/version pin | Loading, update, error | Confirm removals; delegate lifecycle to Pi's package manager |

### Abstraction rule

Extract repeated patterns when they share the **same intent**, not merely because they look similar.

Do not create generic components whose abstraction removes product meaning.

# 10. Responsive & adaptive behavior

## Size classes

### Compact
Below roughly 900px, session index is a drawer; chat remains the default workspace. A visible pane switcher opens Repository or Git Changes as full-width panes; preserve selections, scroll positions and dirty editor buffer when switching. Never reduce controls to inaccessible overflow.

### Medium
Roughly 900–1439px: keep session navigation collapsible; show chat plus one companion pane (Repository or Git Changes) at a time, with a clear switcher. Maintain current session/repository identity and visible Git state.

### Expanded
At 1440px and above, show Bento Triptych work areas together. Show the session index as a rail only when total width leaves roughly ≥420px for Repository/editor, ≥520px for chat and ≥260px for Git Changes (about 1560px overall); otherwise keep session navigation in a drawer. Collapse navigation before shrinking work panes below legible widths.

## Adaptive decisions

- **Session index:** remains global navigation; drawer at compact/medium and whenever expanded width is tight; rail only when three work panes retain minimum widths. Search/filter state survives pane changes.
- **Workspace:** selected session sets repository root; chat, editor and Git Changes remain one session-scoped workspace.
- **Compact:** one work pane visible at a time; chat default; explicit switcher reaches Repository and Git Changes. Keep each pane's scroll, selected file and dirty buffer.
- **Medium:** chat plus one companion pane; expose pane switcher and current pane label.
- **Expanded:** three Bento work areas visible together; session navigation yields space before work panes lose usable width.
- **State/recovery:** never discard editor buffer on pane/session switch without Save / Discard / Cancel; stale file content opens compare/reload recovery; Git actions always carry current repo/branch/file selection.

# 11. State matrix

Every critical screen should define applicable states.

| Screen | Initial | Loading | Populated | Empty | Error | Success | Disabled | Offline | Overflow |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bento session workspace | Launch/reconnect | Snapshot/status | Chat + tree/editor + Git | No session/no repo/clean Git | Save conflict/Git failure/offline | Saved/staged/committed | Read-only session | Daemon unavailable | Long paths, large diffs, narrow pane |

# 12. Visual QA & evidence

The agent must verify rendered output.

## D8 implementation status

D8 round-4 corrections now cover exact Catppuccin Latte/Frappé tokens, theme selection, and rounded/bordered non-pane surfaces. Changed Dart files: `apps/pi_crust/lib/app/app_shell.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/app/desktop_chrome.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/data/daemon/daemon_providers.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/data/daemon/pcp_client.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/data/theme/theme_providers.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/domain/session/session_reducer.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/domain/session/session_state.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/command_palette/command_palette.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/composer/composer.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/composer/composer_draft.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/composer/slash_menu.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/context_panel/context_panel.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/dialogs/extension_ui_dialog.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/session_tree/session_tree_dialog.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/sessions_sidebar/session_actions.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/sessions_sidebar/sessions_sidebar.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/settings/diagnostics.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/settings/settings_view.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/status/agent_status_badge.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/transcript/rich_content.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/transcript/thinking_block.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/transcript/transcript_view.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/features/workspace/repository_workspace.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/main.dart`, `apps/pi_crust/lib/ui/code/code_block.dart`, and `apps/pi_crust/lib/ui/code/diff_block.dart`. `pnpm codegen` verifies 45 command types/43 events; agentd bundle build/smoke and 67 agentd tests pass; 58 Flutter tests and 7 theme-package tests pass. `flutter analyze` has no errors (15 style infos). Windows Release build succeeds. Current debug app starts fresh daemon PID 25088; live `pi.packages.list` returns 16 user packages. `workspace.listFiles` is recognized but no registered active session exists for a safe live file listing. Round-4 review remains changes-requested, not approved.

## D9 rendered evidence

`test/redesign_layout_test.dart` generated fresh synthetic workspace captures in both flavors: light `docs/design-evidence/bento-triptych-fixture-wide.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-compact-files.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-compact-file.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-compact-git.png`; dark `docs/design-evidence/bento-triptych-fixture-dark-wide.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-dark-compact-files.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-dark-compact-file.png`, `bento-triptych-fixture-dark-compact-git.png`. Fixtures exercise the 1440px Bento workspace, session drawer, compact pane switching, file-list/editor return flow and Git Changes. These populated renders are synthetic, not from a connected Pi session.

Fresh Windows debug app runs with new daemon PID 25088 and no Dart runtime errors. Actual Latte Settings capture: `docs/design-evidence/pi-crust-live-settings-latte.png`; actual Frappé Settings capture: `docs/design-evidence/pi-crust-live-settings-frappe.png`; live empty-session home: `docs/design-evidence/pi-crust-live-windows.png` (1280×720 each). Authenticated `pi.packages.list` returned 16 user packages. A read-only `workspace.listFiles` probe was recognized but returned `Session not found` because no session is registered in the fresh daemon; no session or worker was started. Two independent Pi CLI processes remain untouched. Populated workbench captures are separately labelled synthetic fixtures.

Initial compact review found file tree/editor split too cramped and path labels truncated. The consolidated correction gives repository/editor its own file-list→editor transition below 420px, keeps full paths available by tooltip, and collapses session navigation into a drawer until the three work panes retain minimum widths. Fresh screenshots confirm readable compact file browsing/editor and balanced wide panes.

**D9 review round 2:** User reported `workspace.listFiles` failure and requested revised Catppuccin/rounded Bento styling plus session, Git, chat-context, package and resize capabilities. At discovery, active PID 40604 loaded a stale release sidecar (started Oct 5) that lacked `workspace.listFiles`; current source/schema already supported it. `pnpm run build:agentd` rebuilt the daemon, validated the workspace commands in the bundle, and passed an isolated PCP smoke test for `workspace.listFiles` session scoping. `flutter build windows --release` then refreshed the Release package; on-disk sidecar contains both `workspace.listFiles` and `pi.packages.list`. The live PID remains stale in memory and still rejects `pi.packages.list`; its process tree has three child Pi CLI processes. It was not stopped because that may terminate active workers. Wait for a safe user-controlled window before restarting and exercising native repository/package flows.

**D8 feedback slices — Git + sessions:** Removed duplicate changed-file list from Session settings. Git Changes omits untracked files, opens per-file diffs, offers per-file stage/unstage, and undo previews exact diff + confirms before discarding staged/unstaged state. Provenance is evidence-based: successful Pi `write`/`edit` tool calls mark “Tool Pi ha scritto il percorso”; Pi-Crust saves mark “Salvato da te in Pi-Crust”; both show mixed, unobserved/external changes remain unknown. This is event evidence, not guaranteed last-byte authorship. Session list groups by `gitRoot` when available and cwd otherwise, hides `worker#` rows, and offers a new-session dialog with native Windows/macOS folder picker. Web uses explicit daemon-local path entry because browsers do not expose native paths. Official `file_selector` 1.1.0 handles native picking. Tests cover tracked filtering, diff/stage/undo/provenance, repo groups, worker hiding and chosen cwd.

**D8 feedback slice — visual system and layout:** Replaced contrast-shifted Latte hues with official Catppuccin colors; Mauve is the primary accent and semantic statuses use palette Green/Yellow/Red/Blue. Text pairs use palette text colors for contrast. Removed the non-Catppuccin sample theme from the selectable built-in list; settings now offers Latte/Frappé plus user themes. Tests assert exact palette roles, accessible text pairings, source/bundle parity and that selection changes `MaterialApp` colors. Extended modest rounded corners and 1px borders from Bento panes to app/settings headers, session rows, transcript blocks, composer, dialogs, menus and inputs. Existing code/diff surfaces keep the same grammar. Root/app design documents and sidecar contract now retire prior creative references.

**D8 feedback slice — resize responsiveness:** After lazy transcript layout, user reports minimize/maximize stalls seem improved or gone. Record as positive user validation; true fullscreen and long-history performance remain unprofiled. Do not reopen performance work unless the user reports recurrence.

**D8 feedback slice — chat metrics/context:** Pi `get_session_stats` returns cumulative token totals, cost and `contextUsage` (`tokens`, `contextWindow`, `percent`); UI refreshes on session attach, usage and settled events, without inventing missing values. Chat shows model, thinking level and extension `ui.status` values when packages publish them (Caveman/Ponytail metadata is never fabricated). Composer attaches repository files (inline content up to 64 KiB, otherwise path reference) and selected editor code with exact path and line range. Automated tests cover metrics, extension statuses, file context and code ranges.

**D8 feedback slice — Pi packages:** Settings lists user-scope packages through Pi's CLI and supports per-package update, remove and exact npm semver pin, with confirmation for destructive changes. Project packages stay outside this user-scope control to preserve Pi trust rules. Parser/pinning tests, dispatcher tests, actual local `pi list` parsing, Flutter settings test, 67 agentd tests and bundle build pass. The refreshed live daemon now returns 16 user packages; no package was modified.

## Critique findings

Record high-impact issues:

| ID | Severity | Area | Evidence | Fix | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QA-001 | P1 | Compact Repository | Initial 390px render split tree/editor, truncating names and constraining code pane | Switch list/editor below 420px; show full-width file list/editor with back control; provide full-path tooltip; keep session rail hidden until pane minima fit | [x] Confirmed in fresh light/dark compact captures |
| QA-002 | P1 | Native resize responsiveness | User reports minimize/maximize stalls improved or gone after lazy transcript layout; long transcript/fullscreen not profiled | Keep lazy `ListView`; only profile again if native stall recurs | [x] Positive user feedback; no recurrence reported |
| QA-003 | P1 | Theme color fidelity | Latte JSON retained custom dark green/status/syntax values despite Catppuccin label | Map all semantic roles to official Catppuccin values and pair low-contrast statuses with readable text | [x] Exact-color/token tests and live Latte/Frappé selection confirmed |

## Human review log

| Round | Date | Status | Feedback |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 2 | 2026-10-07T08:44:24.099Z | Changes requested | User feedback from live app testing (preserve full intent): (1) Repository pane opens empty; error is `Bad state: Unsupported command type: workspace.listFiles`. (2) Visual direction is unsatisfactory: keep Bento spatial grouping but use a modern VS Code-like treatment—slight borders and small gaps between compartments, rounded corners; current square-off UI feels wrong. Replace DR10 palette with Catppuccin Frappé (dark) and Latte (light), source https://catppuccin.com/palette/. (3) Sessions UX: allow opening/choosing a folder before creating a session in it; show sessions in a tree grouped by folder/repository; hide worker# subagent sessions. Session and Git lists have excessive whitespace. (4) Light theme has odd black components, including chat input. (5) Show Pi session metrics in chat: context-window usage, session cost, model, thinking effort and package-provided controls/metadata such as Caveman and Ponytail levels. (6) Make panels resizable and hideable. (7) Remove redundant Workarea list of modified files; unify with Git Changes, distinguishing agent-authored from manual changes. Git Changes should list modified tracked files; selecting a file opens its diff; per-file plus stages it and undo reverts its changes. (8) Settings should list installed Pi packages and support remove, individual update and version pinning. (9) Composer needs add-files-to-context; selecting code lines and right-clicking should offer `Add to chat` with exact file/line reference. (10) Minimize/restore/fullscreen causes several seconds of unresponsiveness. |
| 4 | 2026-10-07T12:43:12.231Z | Changes implemented; review pending | User reports Catppuccin Latte/Frappé appeared in Settings but still rendered the old palette; replaced off-palette values with official tokens and added live theme-selection coverage. Retired former external design references from active direction. Extended rounded, subtly bordered surfaces beyond panes. User reports minimize/maximize stalls seem improved or gone. Fresh screenshots await review; no approval given. |

**Status:** round 4 changes implemented. Fresh light/dark workspace and live Settings renders are presented for human review round 5. No approval recorded.

# 13. AI-slop quality gate

Before shipping, challenge:

### Genericity test
Would this interface look plausible for an unrelated SaaS / AI dashboard / productivity app?

### Specificity test
What elements are clearly caused by this product's users, content, environment, or brand?

### Justification test
Can every major visual treatment be explained by a user/product need or a documented design principle?

### Restraint test
Could removing a decorative element improve the task?

### Coherence test
Does the same design grammar hold across screens and states?

### Reference fidelity test
When the brief pins a reference, did we preserve its intended principle without blindly cloning its surface?

# 14. Design decision log

### 2026-10-06 — Lock Bento Triptych

**Context:** User requested a Bento-style workspace with chat, active-repository files and Git Changes, preserving Pi-Crust identity and the then-current DR10 palette.
**Evidence:** REF-003/004 (historical app design record), REF-005 (palette at that time), REF-006 (Bento layout reference), user answers Q-VISUAL-DIRECTION and Q-D6-LOCK.
**Decision:** Lock Bento Triptych spatial grouping: co-visible repository/editor, Pi chat and Git Changes on expanded layouts; explicit state-preserving pane switcher on compact layouts. Later D9 feedback supersedes the old palette and surface language.
**Why:** Best matches requested three co-equal work areas without copying VS Code styling; supports balanced throughput and discoverability.
**Alternatives rejected:** Artifact Atlas (overweights editor); Conversation Desk (subordinates repository/Git areas).
**Impact:** Durable spatial direction. D9 revision below supersedes only palette/surface treatment.

### 2026-10-07 — D9 live-review revision and expanded requirements

**Context:** Human reported a workspace command failure and requested revised palette/surfaces plus broader IDE-like workflows.
**Evidence:** REF-010 Catppuccin palette; human D9 review round 2 in §12; reported `workspace.listFiles` error.
**Decision:** Keep Bento topology; use Catppuccin Latte/Frappé and rounded, subtly bordered compartments. Track session tree/folder creation/worker filtering; Pi metrics; resizable/hideable panes; unified Git review/actions with evidence-based provenance; package lifecycle; file/line context; and resize responsiveness.
**Impact:** D9 remains changes_requested pending implementation and fresh review.

### 2026-10-07 — D9 round-4 visual correction

**Context:** User restarted Pi and reported selected Catppuccin themes still looked like the previous palette; non-pane UI retained square, borderless treatment. User retired former external design references and reports minimize/maximize stalls improved or gone.
**Evidence:** Human feedback log round 4; current Latte theme JSON still contains noncanonical green/status/syntax hues; global surface defaults and several custom containers remain square/flat.
**Decision:** Map every semantic role to official Catppuccin values; retain readable text by pairing accents with named palette text/surface colors rather than darkening palette hues. Extend modest rounding and subtle borders to non-pane UI. Keep Bento as topology; preserve resize improvement, do not reopen it without regression.
**Impact:** Return to D8 for correction, then regenerate and present fresh renders. No approval recorded.
